Here are my Google Colab jupyter notebooks. The first one was to search Shared Print Retention Information. The other one was to experiment with the OCLC Knowledge Base API.

##OCLC_KB_API_ISBN
You will need a csv file where the first line of that csv is isbn. Then there is an ISBN on each line.

##OCLC_KB_API_title
You will need a csv file where the first line is title. Then there is the primary title on each line. This notebook will do 4 passes with 4 different types of searches as well as normalize the title.

##oclc_retained_holings_colab_groupedOCLCNumber
You will need a csv file where the first line is oclcNumber. Then there is an OCLC number on each line.
